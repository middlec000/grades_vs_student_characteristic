These groups are formed using characteristics of the students such as ethnicity, income level, or neighborhood. These characteristics must be present in the data file before it is uploaded and likely must be added to the grades file by the teacher.\n\nThis site may be used by anyone wishing to investigate differences in a continuous variable between groups where groups are based on a categorical variable.\n\nView code at: [https://github.com/middlec000/grades_vs_student_characteristic](https://github.com/middlec000/grades_vs_student_characteristic)\n\nCreated by Colin Middleton.\n\nPersonal website: [https://middlec000.github.io/](https://middlec000.github.io/)"
